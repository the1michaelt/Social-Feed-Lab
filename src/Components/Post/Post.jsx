// Within the Post component create a template of how you would like each individual post to be displayed.This will include the user’s name, the body of the post, and the “like” and “dislike” buttons.
// Lastly, you will need to build out the “like” and “dislike” functionality.Within the Post component, create 2 separate functions – one for when the “like” button is clicked, and one for when the “dislike” button is clicked.Bind these functions to their respective buttons onClick event.Within these functions, start to lay out the steps that need to occur when each button is clicked.
